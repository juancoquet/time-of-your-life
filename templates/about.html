        It’s true — without any further context, thinking about your mortality is a depressing and pointless exercise.
        But the goal of Time of Your Life is not to bring you down. Rather, the opposite — I hope it helps you to have
        a better day. Not just today, but every day from here onwards.

        There is a principle in Stoic philosophy called <em>Memento Mori</em>, a saying that translates from Latin as “remember death”.
        By stressing the importance of remembering one’s mortality, Stoic philosophers such as Seneca and Marcus Aurelius
        hoped to give each day a sense of urgency, meaning and fulfilment. They would remind themselves daily that none
        of us are getting off this ride alive, and in doing so they highlighted the importance of making the most of
        <em>today</em> — because ultimately today is all we really have.

        Fast forward a couple of thousand years and lots of things have changed. We went through the Scientific Revolution,
        discovered bacteria, modern physics, invented the engine, electricity, built cars, then planes, then rockets, put a
        man on top of a rocket and sent him to the moon, invented nuclear weapons, computers, the internet, and now we’re 
        even preparing to colonise other planets... but for all this incredible progress, we still face the problem of death.

        And so we must make consequential decisions about how to spend the time given to us. By visually showing you the time 
        that has passed you by, and the time you might yet have left, I hope Time of Your Life helps you to zoom out and gain 
        perspective on how you spend your days.

        Unfortunately, there is nothing more finite than the time we have left to live, and any one of those future weeks in 
        your Life Calendar could be your last. So don’t put off the things that matter, and don’t waste the most valuable 
        resource you have — start that diet, quit that job you hate, go on that trip you’ve been dreaming of, ask that girl 
        out, change up your wardrobe... and for goodness’ sake call your mother once in a while — she’s worried sick.
