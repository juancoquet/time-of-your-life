# Time of Your Life

Time of Your Life takes a user’s date of birth and generates an interactive life calendar — a grid of 4,680 boxes, each representing a week in a 90-year life, with the user’s current week of life highlighted and past weeks greyed out. The user can also add important life events to their calendars (these are things like significant milestones, the birth/death of a loved one, etc.) and they are displayed on their life calendar on the appropriate week. Time of Your Life has had over 600 user accounts created.
Built using Python, Django, Docker, JavaScript, HTML/CSS.
